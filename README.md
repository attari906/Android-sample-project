# Android project for wifi and text to speech
<h4>This application contains two features:</h4>
<p>(1) Wifi Start/Stop - In this feature I used system service for wifi. It contains also a switch for enable disable wifi which is boolean. This app see the cuurent status of wifi that would be either enable or disable. By the switch we can start the wifi, when wifi is currently off. If wifi already is already on we can stop the wifi by switch.</p>
<p>(2) Text to Speech - In this feature I used a EditText and a submit button. In EditText section we can write anything. After writing the text hit submit button for output. The output would be a voice (speak our phone) whatever written in Text box.
